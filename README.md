**Convolutuion in image processing**

In this notebook, the convolution operation which is performed in image processing (channel-by-channel convolution performed over images) is explored in order to get a good sense of what happens behind the scenes during operations like blurring, sharpening and edge filtering. The convolution operation is also used in convolutional layers of a convolutional network mostly due to its filtering capabilities over input volumes.  

This tutorial uses the following libraries (which need to be installed in order to run this notebook on the local machine):
 + **numpy** for implementing the both convolution operations (channel-by-channel and full convolution)
 + **opencv** for image handling
 + **matplotlib** for images plotting
